**thinking of racism part one: the learning part**

<!--StartFragment-->

What is race? Good question! When you hear the word "race," you might think of a car racing. But the meaning of race that we are talking about is sadder--and scarier. The idea of race started out with skin color madness 500 years ago. It divides people based on the color of their skin. It is not based on science. In the past, in our country, they had signs that would say things like "no dogs, Black people, or Italians" and "We want white people in this white country." The pieces of the racism puzzle you might have heard of are slavery or segregation. Racism is hurtful! See the pictures of police using tear gas and Black Lives Mater protesters.

what you are seeing is called police  brutality. Tear gas is something that makes you cry, and then it makes you want to go away from it. the black lives matter protests started in 2013. And in 2020, something awful happened. A black man named George Floyd got choked to death. When the death started happening, he said “I can't breathe” . That said politely “please, let me go” but sadly, he died. The death took about 8 minutes and 46 seconds. That's when the protesters got REALY mad. If you press this word, It will take you to a movie website called [“I am not you negro”](https://www.google.com/search?q=i+am+not+your+negro&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS712US715&oq=i+am+not+your+negro&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59j0l3j69i60l3.1469j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and may rest in peace. the movie script was made by James Baldwin, but is read by a different person because he died in 1987 of stomach cancer. may both people continue in us as we do the thing they wanted us to do before they died[![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/100bc7b917ae7b5d08a33f3d23a18d7d85c949772977735de19eb1c6091cb11d/68747470733a2f2f692e70696e696d672e636f6d2f6f726967696e616c732f64322f64332f66312f64326433663163336338383833386464333938393534393262376538346639622e6a7067)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/100bc7b917ae7b5d08a33f3d23a18d7d85c949772977735de19eb1c6091cb11d/68747470733a2f2f692e70696e696d672e636f6d2f6f726967696e616c732f64322f64332f66312f64326433663163336338383833386464333938393534393262376538346639622e6a7067)
