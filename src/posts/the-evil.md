**THE EVIL**

**by Miriam Kubo** 

Jim Crow laws were evil, twisted, horrid.

Yes, horrid, so never say they are good

because they weren’t.  

It started with the Civil War,

and then the segregation,

and so the protests happened. 

I never would have known. 

People who are darker of the skin

were treated horribly 

and people who were white

were treated like royalty.
