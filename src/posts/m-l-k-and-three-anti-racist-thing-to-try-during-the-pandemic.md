**Three Anti-racist Thing to try during the Pandemic:**

1.) Donate to NAACP

you're probably saying "wait a minute! two a's? what is this thing?!". well, the NAACP Stands for National Association for the Advancement of Collard People. They are a group of lawyers who help people who had racist experiences. Then, they defend their rights. Pretty cool, right? There's more! They started in 1909 and helped end segregation. People's voting rights in the south are not equal. So the National Association for the Advancement of Collard People is helping voting right be equal again. Now, of course, It's not everywhere. But it's a cause we should ensure the right to vote. you can donate or read anti racist news at https://naacp.org/.

2.) If you see a racist person being racist to another person, (if it is violent, then call 911 and film it. this could be used against the person who was racist and shows prof to the police.) tell them to back off and make the person who was being yelled at feel secure.

3.) what can you read or watch to make you an Anti-Racist? If you have no clue, then look at the list here or go to the library or get a book:
