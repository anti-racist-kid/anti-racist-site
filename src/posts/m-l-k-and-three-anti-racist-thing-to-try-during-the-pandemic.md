**M.L.K. Jr. :**

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. speaking at the Civil Rights March on Washington, Aug. 28, 1963. Public domain photo taken from the National Archives and Records Administration.

You probably know that Martin Luther King Jr. was a leader in the civil rights movement. The important activist and his group of anti-racists, like John Lewis, helped end segregation. But did you know that Malcolm X had the opposite approach? Martin Luther King wanted to have peace and non-violence, and Malcolm X believed that it was necessary to fight. Malcolm X talked about Black Power, and how Black people should provide things to the Black community. Part of that was giving people food. And part of it was protecting themselves from violent groups doing bad things, like the Ku Klux Klan burning crosses in front of people's houses. 

This painting by Emma Amos called "Your Choice" is showing M.L.K. Jr. and Malcolm X side by side, one's upside down and one is right side up. It says: "Your Choice." Amos is asking what kind of anti-racism you want to do: Black Power or non-violence. How about you? What do you want to do?

**Three Anti-racist Things to Try during the Pandemic:**

The COVID pandemic keeps going (and with Omicron here, it's even worse). But anti-racist work is a thing you can anywhere, even at home. 

1.) Donate to NAACP

You're probably saying: "Wait a minute! Two A's? What is this thing?!". Well, the NAACP stands for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. They are a group of lawyers that helps people who had racist experiences. Then, they defend their rights. Pretty cool, right? There's more! They started in 1909 and helped end segregation. Nowadays, people's voting rights in the south are not equal. So the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is helping voting rights be equal again. Now, of course, It's not everywhere. But we should ensure the right to vote. You can donate at https://naacp.org/. Ask your family for a Christmas or Hanukkah gift -- for them to donate to NAACP.

2.) If you see a person being racist to another person, like at school or on a bus to school, tell them to back off and make the person who was being yelled at feel secure. If it is violent, film it with your phone or your parents' phone. This could be used against the person who was being dangerous and shows proof to the police. Finally, if things are really bad, go find others so that they can see what's going on, and seek help. 

3.) Even though we're at home a lot, we can still "get outside" with our thinking -- and our reading. What can you read to make you an Anti-Racist? If you have no clue, then look at the list here, or go to the library and get some ideas.
